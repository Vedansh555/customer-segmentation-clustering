🎯 Customer Segmentation using Clustering (K-Means)
This project applies unsupervised machine learning (clustering) to segment customers based on their Annual Income and Spending Score. The goal is to understand different customer groups for targeted marketing strategies and personalized services.

📌 Project Overview
Type: Data Science / Machine Learning

Model Used: K-Means Clustering

Dataset Features:

Annual Income

Spending Score

Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Key Technique: Elbow Method for optimal cluster count

📊 Objective
To group customers into different clusters based on their financial behavior. This helps businesses to:

Target specific income groups

Identify high spenders
